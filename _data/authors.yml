    Hello! My name is Michael and I'm the Lead Software Engineer at  [RC Module](https://www.module.ru/en/). 
    I represent the R&D department, which is responsible for developing end-user digital signal processing devices.

    This blog is used to note some interesting stuff, which may help you folks out there. Stay tuned.

    Bear in mind that every article represents opinion and point of view of the author, not the past/current/future employer.
