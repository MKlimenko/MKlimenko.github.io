    Hello! My name is Michael and I'm an AI Algorithm engineer at [Intel](https://intel.com/), working on the cutting edge of machine learning technology. 
    Former Development Team Leader and Head of GNSS at [RC Module](https://www.module.ru/en/), where I represented the R&D department, which is responsible for developing end-user digital signal processing devices.

    This blog is used to note some interesting stuff, which may help you folks out there. Stay tuned.

    Bear in mind that every article represents the opinion and point of view of the author, not the past/current/future employer.
